Launch applications in an alternative (administrator) context without having to type your alternate account credentials every time.  This can help mitigate shoulder surfing of your password being typed many times during your day.

The most important premise of the Nox Toolbox is that you can launch it using an administrator account and everything you run (unless you configure an item to Run As Session User) is run in that administrator context.  This is useful when an admin account is used many times a day and that password is typed many times.  Since an admin account should be complex and hard to guess the ability to type it once at the start of a business day and then have all of your admin tools run under that admin account both increases security and helps prevent shoulder surfing of admin accounts.

Perform quick diagnostics on local or remote servers or computers to determine the status of its configuration.  Save time when working with infrastructure that you administer.

With many IT professionals it is time consuming to setup a new computer and re-install all of the administration and development tools they use.  Toolbox items can also serve as reminders as to what your toolset looks like on a new machine.  Besides configuration and notes there is an "Installer" reference field that can be used to point to a website, UNC or other source of the installer.  This allows you to quickly get back up and running on a new machine and be confident that your system has all the tools you need.
